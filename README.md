# Domino Tiling Algebraic Symmetry & Classification Verifiers

This repository provides the official implementation of the Computational Verification Protocol described in the paper:
**"Algebraic Symmetries and the 90-Degree Rotation Complementarity Theorem in Domino Tilings of the $4 \times 4$ Natural Square"** by Kenichi Takemura.

## 🛡️ Computational Verification Protocol
To ensure mathematical rigor and reproducibility, these scripts follow a formal verification protocol:

1. **Normalization (Canonical Form):** All 36 tilings are stored in a canonical integer matrix format. ID labels (0–7) are reassigned using a row-major normalization function to eliminate duplicates and labeling artifacts.
2. **Population Completeness:** The set of 36 tilings is verified against Kasteleyn’s formula ($\sqrt{|\det A|} = 36$). Symmetry closure under the $D_4$ group is confirmed via Burnside's Lemma.
3. **Existence & Multiplicity Analysis:** Beyond verifying pairwise identities, this protocol enumerates all possible valid partitions. It proves that while a perfect complementary partition always exists, there are exactly 12 distinct ways to achieve it.

## 🔢 Script Mapping & Functionality

### 0. Population & Symmetry Audit
* **File:** `calculator0_symmetry_check.py`
* **Corresponding Result:** Theorem 2 & Table 2
* **Description:** Verifies the 8 elements of the dihedral group $D_4$ acting on the 36 tilings. It confirms the 9 symmetry classes (families) and the count of fixed points for each transformation.

### 1. 90-Degree Rotation Verifier
* **File:** `Domino Tiling Calculator1.py`
* **Corresponding Result:** Theorem 3 (90-Degree Rotation Product Sum Theorem)
* **Identity:** $S_{\text{prod}}(P) + S_{\text{prod}}(P^{90}) = 1,428$ for all $P \in \mathcal{P}$.

### 2. Power Sums of 2-Block Sums
* **File:** `Domino Tiling Calculator2.py`
* **Corresponding Result:** Theorem 5 & Table 5
* **Identity:** Verifies that for the 18 specific pairs $(P_i, P_j)$, the sums of $k$-th powers of 2-block sums are invariant for $k=1, 2, 3$.
    * $k=1: \sum (x+y)^1 = 272$
    * $k=2: \sum (x+y)^2 = 5,848$
    * $k=3: \sum (x+y)^3 = 141,032$

### 3. Product Square Sum Analysis
* **File:** `Domino Tiling Calculator3.py`
* **Corresponding Result:** Section 6 (Further Observations)
* **Description:** Demonstrates the "breaking" of invariance at $S_{\text{prod}^2}$ and its congregation into 4 specific discrete values across the 18 pairs.

### 4. Integrated Partition Verifier
* **File:** `Domino Tiling Calculator4.py`
* **Corresponding Result:** Theorem 5 (Algebraic Perfect Complementary Partition)
* **Description:** An integrated verifier that confirms the 36 tilings can be partitioned into 18 pairs satisfying all simultaneous algebraic identities described in the paper.

### 5. Multiplicity & Enumeration Proof
* **File:** `enumerate_all_partitions.py`
* **Corresponding Result:** Theorem 5.5 (Multiplicity of Partitions)
* **Description:** Uses a graph-theoretical approach to enumerate all valid perfect matchings. It proves the multiplicity is exactly 12, derived from the product of internal matching possibilities of specific subgraphs ($K_4$ and $K_{2,2}$).
