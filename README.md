Code Structure Highlights
	•	NATURAL_SQUARE: Defines the standard numerical configuration of the $4 \times 4$ grid (1 to 16).
	•	PATTERNS_RAW: Defines the 36 unique tiling topologies using block labels (A, B, C...).
	•	parse_pattern_to_domino_values: Extracts the pairs of numbers covered by each domino.
	•	calculate_s_prod: Computes the sum of products, $S_{\text{prod}}$.
	•	get_rotated_pattern_str: Performs the $90^\circ$ clockwise geometric rotation.
	•	normalize_pattern_str / find_rotated_pair_id: These crucial functions normalize the block labels of the rotated pattern to correctly identify the corresponding Tiling ID (P1-P36) in the master list.

Domino Tiling Rotation Invariant Verifier No.2

This repository contains the Python code for verifying the Complementarity Theorem for the Power Sums of 2-Block Sums in domino tilings of the $4 \times 4$ natural square.
The program numerically confirms that for 18 specific pairs of algebraically symmetric tilings, the sum of their power sums $S_{\mathrm{sum}}^k(P) = \sum_{i=1}^8 (x_i + y_i)^k$ is invariant for powers $k=1, 2, 3$ but congregates into four distinct values for $k=4$.
Associated Publication
The verification results generated by this program are featured in Section 4 of the following paper:
Title: Algebraic Symmetries and the 90-Degree Rotation Complementarity Theorem in Domino Tilings of the $4 \times 4$ Natural Square
Verified Identities (Summary)
The program verifies that for the 18 defined algebraically symmetric pairs $(P_i, P_j)$, the following identity holds for $k=1, 2, 3$, and the congregation result for $k=4$:
k
Identity (Invariant Ck / Congregation Set)
1
$S_{\text{sum}}^1(P_i) + S_{\text{sum}}^1(P_j) = \mathbf{272}$ (Invariant)
2
$S_{\text{sum}}^2(P_i) + S_{\text{sum}}^2(P_j) = \mathbf{5,848}$ (Invariant)
3
$S_{\text{sum}}^3(P_i) + S_{\text{sum}}^3(P_j) = \mathbf{141,032}$ (Invariant)
4
$S_{\text{sum}}^4(P_i) + S_{\text{sum}}^4(P_j) \in \{ 3,605,224, \ 3,606,664, \ 3,628,264, \ 3,629,704 \}$(Congregates into 4 values)

Domino Tiling Rotation Invariant Verifier No.4
This repository contains the Python code for verifying the existence and unique partition of Complete Complementary Pairs based on the Extended High-Order Complementary Identity in the domino tilings of the $4 \times 4$ natural square.
The program searches all 36 tiling patterns for pairs $(P_i, P_j)$ where the sum of four distinct algebraic metrics ($S_{\mathrm{sum}}^1, S_{\mathrm{sum}}^2, S_{\mathrm{sum}}^3, S_{\mathrm{prod}}$) simultaneously satisfies its respective invariant constant. The ultimate goal is to confirm that all 36 patterns are uniquely classified into 18 such pairs.
Associated Publication and Theorem
This program numerically proves the theorem concerning the Extended High-Order Complementary Identitydetailed in the following paper:
Title: Algebraic Symmetries and the 90-Degree Rotation Complementarity Theorem in Domino Tilings of the $4 \times 4$ Natural Square
Extended High-Order Complementary Identity (Theorem)
A pair $(P_i, P_j)$ is defined as a Complete Complementary Pair if it simultaneously satisfies all four of the following identities:
Identity
Sum Definition
Invariant C
$\mathbf{S_{\mathrm{sum}}^1}$
$\sum (x+y)^1$
$C_1 = 272$
$\mathbf{S_{\mathrm{sum}}^2}$
$\sum (x+y)^2$
$C_2 = 5,848$
$\mathbf{S_{\mathrm{sum}}^3}$
$\sum (x+y)^3$
$C_3 = 141,032$
$\mathbf{S_{\mathrm{prod}}}$
$\sum (x \cdot y)$
$C_{\mathrm{prod}} = 1,428$
Usage
	1	Install the required dependencies: Bash  pip install numpy
	2	   
	3	Execute the Python script: Bash  python complete_complementary_pair_verifier.py
	4	   
Output Interpretation
The program searches for 18 Complete Complementary Pairs among all 36 patterns and reports whether the unique partition was successful.
	•	Upon successful verification: The output will confirm: "SUCCESS: All 36 tilings are uniquely partitioned into 18 Complete Complementary Pairs, as stated by the theorem."
	•	Details for each discovered pair will be printed, showing that the sum of the four algebraic metrics matches the target invariants ($C_1, C_2, C_3, C_{\mathrm{prod}}$).
